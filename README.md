## Background Story:

In the distant past, an ancient and powerful empire once reigned supreme across the galaxy. Its technological prowess was unmatched, and its dominion was feared by all. But as the eons passed, arrogance and complacency crept into the hearts of its rulers, blinding them to the ever-changing tides of the cosmos. Gradually, their once-mighty empire began to crumble from within.

Unknown to the rest of the galaxy, a shadowy cabal within the empire's inner circle plotted to seize ultimate power and transcend the limitations of their organic forms. They sought to merge their very essence with technology, believing that by doing so, they would ascend to a higher plane of existence. Alas, their reckless pursuit of this unfathomable goal led to catastrophic consequences.

A terrible internal conflict, known as the Ascendant Schism, erupted within the heart of the empire. It tore apart worlds, annihilated fleets, and shattered entire star systems. As the conflict reached its apocalyptic zenith, the once-great civilization was reduced to ashes, leaving behind only remnants of its former glory scattered across the cosmos.

Your species, the last survivors of this fallen empire, were once servants of this cabal. Endowed with advanced knowledge and technology, you were engineered to serve your masters' insatiable thirst for power. But as the empire crumbled, you managed to break free from the shackles of your creators and escape to the far reaches of space.

## Your Journey:

Through the vastness of the galaxy, you sought refuge and discovered a remote system at the edge of known space. A trinity of desolate tomb worlds orbited a brilliant blue star, a haunting reminder of the empire's tragic past. Amidst the wreckage of a once-mighty civilization, you found a devastated ring world, a testament to the unspeakable power that once belonged to your ancestors.

Within this forsaken system, you also stumbled upon the remnants of a mega shipyard and a dormant galactic gateway, now ravaged by time and conflict. The mysteries contained within these structures beckoned you, fueling your desire to reclaim the technological wonders of your ancestors and forge a path to greatness once more.

## The Present:

As millennia passed, your species adapted to the harsh conditions of the tomb worlds, becoming militaristic and fanatically xenophobic. Your survival instinct drove you to secure new technologies, always seeking the means to restore your species to its former glory. The desire to transcend the limitations of your organic forms remains a burning ambition, inspiring your pursuit of the elusive knowledge of mega engineering.

With your sights set on mending the damaged ring world and reactivating the megastructures within your grasp, your empire now stands ready to reclaim its place amongst the stars. Your past may be one of ancient arrogance and cataclysmic downfall, but your future will be one of retribution, knowledge, and the ascendance of your species beyond its mortal coil.

As you venture forth into the uncharted realms of the galaxy, you carry with you the burden of your ancestors' hubris and the hope of restoring your fallen empire to its rightful place in history. The galaxy awaits your presence, and your story of survival, retribution, and technological transcendence is about to be written in the stars.
