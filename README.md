## Background Story (Rough GPT draft lmao):

Thousands of years ago, a once-mighty and advanced empire stood among the stars. Their technologies surpassed the imagination of all other species in the galaxy, and they wielded their power with an iron fist. But such greatness often sows the seeds of arrogance and decadence. As the eons passed, the empire became complacent, its rulers careless and detached from the realities of the universe.

During this time of decline, the empire came across a unique blue star system, hidden amidst the vast cosmic expanse. Eager to explore the system's wonders, they dispatched a fleet led by their most esteemed scientists and admirals. What they discovered was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.

Within the system, they found not one but three tomb worlds, scorched by past cataclysms that rendered them inhospitable to most life forms. These planets bore witness to ancient, forgotten civilizations, obliterated by some unknown force. Their discoveries intrigued the empire, but arrogance clouded their judgment, and they proceeded recklessly.

In the heart of the system lay a once-majestic planet, now reduced to a desolate and lifeless husk. Its surface bore scars of colossal battles, suggesting an apocalypse of untold proportions. The empire, ever hungry for knowledge and new technologies, dispatched teams to delve into the planet's ruins. However, their insatiable thirst for power blinded them to the dangers that lay dormant beneath the shattered surface.

Unleashed by their careless hands, ancient machines of unimaginable power awoke, unleashing devastation upon the empire. The glorious fleets were decimated, planets laid to waste, and entire solar systems were plunged into chaos. A cataclysmic battle unfolded that spanned across the galaxy, and in the end, the once-proud empire was brought to its knees.

The remnants of this fallen civilization, who survived the onslaught, retreated to the blue star system where their downfall began. They vowed never to forget the mistakes of their past and embraced a militaristic, xenophobic ideology. Fearful of outsiders, they closed their borders, guarding their newfound home with unyielding vigilance.

Despite their shattered state, the remnants held onto fragments of their past glory. They discovered a damaged Ring World surrounding one of the tomb worlds, a partially functioning Mega Shipyard, and a damaged Galactic Gateway, all remnants of the lost empire's technological prowess.

These shattered relics and the system's strategic location became the core of their ambition. Their ultimate goal was to ascend their species through melding flesh and steel, embracing both biologic and cybernetic advancements. This pursuit of perfection, driven by a desire to atone for the past and reach new heights, became the essence of their society.
